Project Title: What number am I thinking of?

Description:

The goal of the game is for the user to guess the number the app has chosen. If the user has guessed the number correctly, the user is notified that they have guessed the number. The number changes after each correct or incorrect guess by the user. The number generated is a random number. The random number will be in the range of the difficulty level chosen.
The home page of the app will have the title of our app “What number am I thinking of?” under it will have 3 buttons each displaying the preset difficulties (Normal, Hard, Good Luck). Once the user chooses their difficulty level the buttons will be replaced with an input text box and under that would be a button with “Guess!” on it. The text box will be where the user will guess the respective number. At the top of the screen there will be text that displays the range of numbers (that are based on the difficulty level). For example if they selected “Normal“ there will be the text “Guess the number from 1-10!”. 

The game could look like a graphing paper background where the font is handwriting, almost like a math themed game. If the user makes a correct guess the screen will flash a positive message like “GOOD JOB” if the guess is wrong then there will be a more motivating message like “Nice try”. The game ends once 5 wrong guesses are made. When the game ends, the number of right guesses made in the game is shown to the player as a score, where each correct guess accounts for 1 point. The scoreboard keeps track of the player’s high scores where a maximum of 3 high scores from each respective difficulty is stored (i.e. Normal difficulty will have its own scoreboard). The button labeled hint will show if the random number is odd or even.


Functional Requirements
* Players must click on one of the 3 buttons to make a difficulty level choice
* * “Normal”, “Hard”,  “Good Luck” 
* * * Normal: (1 - 10)
* * * Hard: (1-50)
* * * Good Luck: (1- 100)
* Buttons have sound effect like a pop
* Players must put their guess in the input box located at the center of the screen
* The button with “Guess!” is clicked on to submit their guess
* The number generated is a random number
* The random number will be in the range of the difficulty level chosen
* When a correct guess is made, a message is shown on the screen to notify the player
* When an incorrect guess is made, a message is shown on the screen to notify the player
* The game ends when the user gets a certain amount of guesses wrong
* * Ie. like if they get 5 wrong then the game ends
* The number of correct guesses made in the game is shown when the game ends
* A score that is a representation of how many correct guesses they had
* A scoreboard to represent user’s high scores (holds up to 3 scores per difficulty)
* A button labeled hint that can give whether the number is even or odd
